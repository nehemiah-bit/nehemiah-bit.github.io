    INTP perssonality:
    I like solving puzzles very much! 
    I enjoy seeking understanding persistently through researching, reading, thinking and experimenting.
    (Matthew 7:7-8)
    I enjoy building things (and play with it) using newly discovered skills and knowledge.
    
    One of my interest is to learn to write musical notes using ansi code / text code, just as PDF writer.
    and then actually produce a song with notes for Mana Cell of my church.
